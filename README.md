# Weather & Vacation Analysis with Python
---

## 🗺️ Project Overview:

This project leverages Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and API requests to analyze weather data and recommend vacation destinations based on ideal weather conditions. The project is divided into two parts:

- **WeatherPy:** Uses OpenWeatherMap API to gather weather data for over 500 randomly selected cities worldwide and analyzes relationships between weather variables and latitude.

- **VacationPy:** Uses Geoapify API to find ideal vacation spots based on selected weather conditions and locates nearby hotels.

## 📂 Files Included

### 1️⃣ Jupyter Notebook Files

  - `WeatherPy.ipynb` → Starter file that will help pull weather data for cities around the world to help filter and collect necessary parameters for filtering in the second Jupyter Notebook file.

  - `VacationPy.ipynb` → Secondary file that will help narrow down generated list of cities to meet personal parameters of humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, and max temperature. This file will also narrow down the list of prime locations to include only ones with hotels nearby.

### 2️⃣ Output Files (Located in `output_data/` Folder)

  - `City Latitude vs. Cloudiness.png` → Will be generated by `WeatherPy` Jupyter Notebook file.

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze global weather patterns and identify ideal vacation destinations based on specific climate conditions. By leveraging Python, API data retrieval, and interactive mapping, this project achieves the following objectives:

### 1.) Weather Analysis (WeatherPy)

  - Collect real-time weather data for 500+ cities worldwide using the OpenWeatherMap API.

  - Analyze the correlation between latitude and key weather factors such as:

    - Temperature 🌡️

    - Humidity 💧

    - Cloudiness ☁️

    - Wind Speed 🌬️

  - Implement linear regression to explore trends across the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
 
### 2.) Vacation Planning (VacationPy)

  - Filter locations based on ideal vacation weather conditions (e.g., moderate temperatures, low wind speeds, and clear skies).
    
  - Use the Geoapify API to find the nearest hotels for selected locations

  - Generate interactive maps to visualize vacation spots and hotel locations.

### 3.) Data Visualization & Insights

  - Utilize Matplotlib, SciPy, and hvPlot to create meaningful visual representations of weather trends.

  - Build interactive geographic plots using GeoViews and OpenStreetMap tiles.

By achieving these objectives, this project demonstrates how data-driven insights can be used to optimize travel planning and improve our understanding of weather patterns worldwide.
